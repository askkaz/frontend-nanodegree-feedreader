# Project Overview

This project is a [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test of a feedreader site.

The tests ensure that the RSS feeds are defined properly, the menu behaves appropriately, and that the entries and feed selection work properly.

To see the results of the test, load index.html in a web browser, or go to my [github](https://askkaz.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
